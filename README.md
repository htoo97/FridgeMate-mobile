FridgeMate is the essential companion app to the most common utility found in every modern household. It helps the user keep on top of items in the fridge and plan out meals to avoid waste. It enables easily managing a shared fridge by streamlining the food sharing experience without worrying about crossing boundaries. It can also suggest the clueless user recipes of what to do with the ingredients in the fridge. With these features, FridgeMate would enrich the household experience and help prevent the food wastage problem.
